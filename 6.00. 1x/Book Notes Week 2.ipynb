We know that the iteration of `factI` will terminate because `n` starts out positive and each time around the loop it is reduced by 1. This means that it cannot be greater than 1 forever. Similarly, if `factR` is called with `1`, it returns a value without making a recursive call. When it does make a recursive call, it always does so with a value one less than the value with which it was called. Eventually the recursion terminates with the call `factR(1)`."
