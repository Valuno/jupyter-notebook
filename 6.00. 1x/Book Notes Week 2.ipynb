That is to say, for any pair of distinct numbers,`n1` and `n2`, either `n1 < n2` or `n1 > n2`. So we can think of the square root of x as lying somewhere on the line  \n",

If too small, the answer must be to the right. Then we repeat the process on the smaller interval. This is called a **bisection search**. Here's an example, approximating a square root below."
